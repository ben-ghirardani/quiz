Bugs to solve - 

1) Tidy up code! Check indentation on every page, etc.
2) Is score updating quickly enough? Include promise to make sure it's being captured before moving to next screen?
3) folder naming convention - folders which are functions in camelCase? Folders which are classes CamelCase?
4) change Loading to a spinning icon?
5) is it obvious that the user can scroll down in categories now that scroll is hidden?
6) add an animation to Landing Page to hide the fact that it waits for data to fetch.

*** possible to create an animation effect that pulses colour to show that something is an option to click?

super(props) deprecated? Look into this.
